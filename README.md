# maction_potential_2022

This is a repository for the 2022-23 Maction Potential EEG activated nicotine administration device.

For any person associated with the NeurotechX 2023 student competition, please direct your attention to the "Submission 2023" folder, here you will find the final version of our documented code. It contains additional commentary around some of the decisions we have made. Additionally, you will find resources needed to run the code. Everything should be set up so that using the code is straightforward. Thank you.

The signal_processing folder contains all code relevant to EEG data handling and feature extraction. This is mainly being modified by the signal processing team.

The GUI folder contains any code relevant to generating a user interface for the project. It is mainly being handled by the software development team. 

The Arduino folder contains all code relevant to working with the Arduino and thus mechanical portion of the project. This is also being worked on by the software development team.
